# Proyecto-E-commerce-DU-VINE--
"E-commerce web project"

Welcome to our beverage eCommerce project called DU VINE, we have used modern technologies like HTML5, CSS3, SCSS and JavaScript to create an engaging and satisfying user experience. Our page is responsive and we have implemented UX/UI techniques to improve usability and accessibility. Additionally, we use Rest APIs and JWTs to communicate with our server and authenticate our users. For version control, we use Git and GitHub and follow the Scrum and Kanban methodology to meet our objectives in a timely manner. In short, we have created a combination of attractive design, intuitive user experience and modern technologies to provide the best possible experience for our users on DU VINE.
